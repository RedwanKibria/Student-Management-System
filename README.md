# Student-Management-System

This application should do the followings:

-Ask the user how many new students will be added in the database

-The user should prompted to enter the name and year of each student

-The student should have a 5-digit unique id, with the first number being their university year

-A student can enroll in courses

-Each course costs Â£700 to enroll

-The students should be able to view their balance and pay the tuition

-To see the status of students, we should see their name, id, course enrolled and balance.
